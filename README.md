# Identification of fraud in financial transaction

Here I developed various machine learning models and studied their performance over a imbalanced [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  

Models developed and studied were: 
- Random forset
- SVM
- A shallow neural network
- Logistic regression

**Conclusion:** 
- The shallow neural netowrk model with two dense layers performed well on holdout data, achieving 90% accuracy.
